Fork the project and use python and releated frameworks to finish the project. 


## Task 1
- Crawl movies from IMDB's page. The target URL is:
``` 
http://www.imdb.com/movies-coming-soon/ 
```
- The infomations we're going to crawl include title, cover image and IMDB score. 
- Use any crawl frameworks you are familiar with, or write one for yourself.
-  Save the data you crawled to whatever database you like.


## Task 2
- As having some movies data in our database, we're going to build a simple web page to show the movies.
- Write a simple website to display the movies as a list. Also, title, cover image and IMDB score are needed here.


## Task 3
- Now we have crawler and website, the last thing we need is a simple admin form for maintain the movies.
- Finish the following functions: create/update/delete movies. 


One more thing, for the three tasks above, maybe  messages we provide are not enough. So please be more thoughful and use your rich experiences to finish a nice project.
